# Authorization System Implementation

## Changes Made

1. **Added UserClaim Entity Support**:
   - Added migration setup for storing permission claims in UserClaim table
   - Enhanced UserRepository to load claims with Include() method

2. **Permission System**:
   - Created Permissions class with constants for all permissions
   - Added role-based permission sets (Admin, TenantAdmin, StandardUser)
   - Implemented IRequireAuthorization interface for MediatR requests

3. **Authorization Pipeline**:
   - Implemented PermissionRequirementBehavior for MediatR
   - Integrated with JWT token generation to include permission claims

4. **Permission Management**:
   - Created PermissionManager utility for managing user permissions
   - Implemented automatic permission sync based on user roles
   - Added GetUserPermissions and UpdateUserPermissions endpoints

5. **Seed Data**:
   - Created initial migration to seed admin user with all permissions
   - Set up system tenant for administrative purposes

6. **Infrastructure**:
   - Created AdminService.Migrations project for database migrations
   - Updated Docker configuration for running migrations

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Migration**: Run the initial migration to create database schema and seed data
   ```
   docker-compose up -d postgres
   docker-compose up migrations
   docker-compose up adminservice-api
   ```

2. **Test Authorization Flow**: Verify the complete authorization pipeline works correctly
   - Login as admin
   - Test different permission checks
   - Create users with different roles and verify access control

3. **Update Role Management**: Add endpoints for role management
   - Implement AssignRoleEndpoint
   - Create RoleManager utility

4. **Add Permission Override**: Allow assigning custom permissions beyond role-based ones

5. **Add Permission Auditing**: Log permission checks and authorization failures

## Project Improvements

1. **Security**: The authorization system now provides fine-grained control over user permissions
2. **Maintainability**: Centralized permission checks reduce code duplication
3. **Flexibility**: Role-based and individual permission assignments allow for customized access
4. **Performance**: JWT claims enable efficient permission checks without database queries
